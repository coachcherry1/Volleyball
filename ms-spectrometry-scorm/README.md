# Mass Spectrometry — Reading the Fragments

A click-and-drag SCORM 1.2 activity for Schoology. Students work out what an EI mass
spectrum's molecular ion has lost to make each peak — −15, −18, −29, −43 — then use those
losses to identify the compound, and finally predict which peak will be tallest from the
structure alone.

Built as a companion to the IR diagnostic-region activity: same drag-a-label interaction,
same three-level arc, same accessibility guarantees. The chemistry is different, and so is
the central question — IR asks *which bond is this*, mass spec asks *what did the molecule
lose, and why was what is left stable enough to survive*.

---

## The one idea the whole package is built on

**The tall peaks are the stable cations.** 3° > 2° > 1° > methyl, and a fragment that
keeps an O, an N or a ring beats all of them, because those spread the charge. Every level,
every hint and every piece of feedback comes back to that.

Four mechanisms, and no more:

| Mechanism | What breaks | Why the cation survives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **α-cleavage** | the bond next to an O or an N | the O or N next door helps hold the charge |
| **Dehydration** | an alcohol throws off water | −18, the alcohol flag |
| **Branch-point cleavage** | the bond at the most substituted carbon | 3° > 2° > 1°; *tert*-butyl at m/z 57 is the showcase |
| **Benzylic cleavage** | the bond one carbon out from a ring | the ring spreads the charge, m/z 91 |

The McLafferty rearrangement is deliberately not taught. See
[The McLafferty decision](#the-mclafferty-decision) below for how the bank stays honest
about it anyway.

---

## Everything is a loss from the molecular ion

The whole package works in one frame: **find M⁺, then ask what each peak below it is
missing.** Both labelling levels use the same tiles —

```
   M − 15        M − 18       M − 29               M − 43
   lost •CH₃     lost H₂O     lost •C₂H₅ or •CHO   lost •C₃H₇ or CH₃CO•
```

— and both draw from the same pool, because both need a molecular ion you can actually
subtract from. A loss is computed per compound at run time rather than stored anywhere:
**CH₃CO⁺ sits at m/z 43 in both acetone and 2-butanone**, but it is a loss of 15 from one
and a loss of 29 from the other.

That is what makes −29 and −43 worth teaching rather than listing. Four masses in this bank
are ambiguous — 29, 43, 57 and 105 — and `ANSWER_KEY.md` tables each one with what settles
it.

### Students are never asked to name a fragment

The fragment names — CH₃C≡O⁺, C₇H₇⁺, CH₂=OH⁺ — are **recognition material only**. They
appear in the correlation table, in the Level 3 cards and in feedback, but no student is
ever asked to produce one, and no drag tile carries one. An earlier version asked for them
at Level 2 and it was too advanced: it wanted a fragment's identity before the student had
any idea what the compound was.

Nor are the words *acylium*, *oxocarbenium*, *iminium* or *tropylium* used anywhere a
student can see. Where a fragment is described, it is described by what it kept — "keeps
the C=O", "keeps the oxygen", "alkyl fragment (3°)".

The stability reasoning is all still there — *3° beats 2° beats 1°, and an O, N or ring
next door beats all of them* — it just never depends on knowing a name for the ion class.

### The alkyl series

15, 29, 43, 57, 71 — each one CH₂ (14) bigger than the last. The reference table shows the
run, and the point is made explicitly: a ladder of peaks 14 apart means a chain coming
apart at every C–C bond, and **which one is tallest** is the useful part. A big m/z 57
means a *tert*-butyl and a branch point; an even run with no clear winner means a straight
chain. Every member from 29 upwards shares its mass with a fragment that kept a C=O, which
is the −29 / −43 lesson again in a different costume.

---

## The three levels

| Level | Name | What the student does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Read the losses** | The compound is named and drawn. Label each marked peak with what the molecule lost: −15, −18, −29, −43. Correlation table available. Six spectra. |
| 2 | **Which compound is it?** | The same labelling job, but the compound is hidden — and **three candidate structures sit under the plot from the moment the item opens**. Read M⁺ off the plot, work out what each candidate weighs, label the losses, then say which one it is. Six spectra. |
| 3 | **Predict the base peak** | **No spectrum.** From the structure alone, choose which loss leaves the most stable fragment, then work out where it lands. The spectrum is revealed afterwards, annotated, as the answer. Six compounds. |

Level 2 is deliberately the same *task* as Level 1 with something taken away and something
given back. Taken away: the compound’s name. Given back: three structures to choose between,
and the correlation table stays open. A student who can do Level 1 can do Level 2 — they just
have to work out which compound they are holding before the arithmetic means anything, and the
candidates make that a comparison rather than a blank.

Levels unlock in order. Wrong answers are never penalised: the tile returns to the tray
and the feedback explains the discriminator.

Eighteen items is a full class period. To shorten it, change `items` in the `LEVELS` table
at the top of `src/js/game.js`; each level needs at least five to keep one compound per
theme.

### Level 3 in detail

Two questions per compound, both answerable from the structure:

1. **Which loss leaves the most stable fragment?** Each competing route is a card led by
   the loss — `Lose •C₂H₅ (M − 29)` — with what it leaves underneath. Picking a loser
   explains *why* it loses.
2. **At what m/z does it appear?** The arithmetic, with the masses of the losing routes
   offered as decoys — every option is a number a student could genuinely have reached.

The neutral on each card is **computed from the formulas**, not looked up, because the
lookup would be wrong: the table offers "−43 = •C₃H₇ or CH₃CO•", and for acetophenone only
the second is true. Subtracting the fragment from the molecule settles it every time.

Only then does the spectrum appear, with the full ordering of routes spelled out
underneath it.

A compound is only eligible for Level 3 if it offers **two or more competing losses** —
`tools/validate.js` refuses the tag otherwise. That rules out benzaldehyde, whose base peak
is the molecular ion itself, so there is no winning loss to pick.

---

## Learning to ignore the noise

This is not a level. It is a property of every single item — a spectrum draws 15–25 peaks
and asks about 2–4 of them. Three mechanisms do the work:

**1. A threshold line.** Every plot carries a dashed line at 5% of the base peak, captioned
*below this line — don't read it*. It is the direct structural analogue of the 1500 cm⁻¹
line in the IR package. Peaks below it are drawn in a lighter ink — but colour is never the
only signal, because the line is drawn and captioned and every quiet peak says so when
clicked.

**2. Every non-answer peak explains itself.** Click any stick and it tells you why it is
not one of the answers. There are five different reasons, and they are not interchangeable:

- *below the line* — "m/z 38 is 2% of the base peak. Not worth your attention."
- *chatter* — "m/z 41 is 42%, well above the line, so it is a real peak. But it narrows
  nothing down: almost every chain of this length throws one off."
- *a ring breaking up further* — for m/z 51 and 65, which corroborate a ring and nothing more
- *an isotope peak* — M+1, M+2, or a ¹³C satellite, with the carbon-counting lesson attached
- *a rearrangement* — the McLafferty peaks, below

**3. Real fragments that are simply not the marked peak.** The second reason above would be a
lie about benzaldehyde's m/z 29, which genuinely *is* CHO⁺. So a cluster peak whose fragment
is well stabilised or tertiary gets a different message — "it really is CHO⁺, it is genuine
chemistry, it is just not one of the peaks marked for you here."

A few peaks carry a hand-written `note` that overrides all of the above, because the stock
wording would mislead. CH₂=OH⁺ turning up at 25% in *2-butanol* is the clearest case: the
stock hint says *m/z 31 means a primary alcohol*, which would be exactly the wrong lesson
in a secondary alcohol. Those peaks say instead that reaching m/z 31 there takes a hydrogen
shift, and that the landmark only holds when m/z 31 is the **base peak**.

---

## Seeing what is left

Naming a loss is arithmetic. Seeing *which piece walked off and which piece kept the
charge* is the chemistry, and until a structure is drawn the stability argument has nothing
to attach to. So every labelled peak gets a picture.

At Level 1, a **What is left** panel builds up under the plot as the student works: one
skeletal drawing per labelled peak, with the departing piece **dashed and faded**, a red
**+** on the atom holding the charge, and a caption naming the neutral. By the end of a
spectrum the student has the whole fragmentation laid out side by side — which is what
makes Level 3 answerable later, where the same drawings appear on the cards being chosen
between.

At Level 2 the panel waits until the compound has been identified. Drawing the right
skeleton mid-item would answer the question the level is asking.

### The pictures are derived, not drawn by hand

Nothing in `compounds.js` says which atoms a fragment keeps. It is worked out:

1. **Hydrogens are counted back from the bonds.** A carbon has 4 minus the bond orders
   around it; a vertex inside an aromatic ring carries one more bond order than its drawn
   bonds show; heteroatom labels state their own hydrogens (`OH` is one, `NH₂` is two).
2. **Each bond is cut in turn.** If one of the two pieces has exactly the fragment's
   formula, that piece is what kept the charge.
3. Hydrogen counts come from the **intact** structure — when R–R′ breaks, the carbon that
   lost the bond becomes a carbocation with an empty orbital; it does not pick up a
   hydrogen.

That makes the picture self-checking, and `tools/validate.js` checks it twice: every
structure must reproduce its own molecular formula from the drawing alone (all 30 do), and
every labelled peak must yield a picture whose kept atoms have exactly the fragment's
formula. A structure with a missing bond fails the build.

Where more than one bond gives a piece of the right formula, the mechanism decides:
α-cleavage puts the charge next to the O or N, benzylic keeps the ring, and a break at a
branch point leaves the **most substituted** carbon holding it — 3° over 2°, which is the
whole lesson, so the picture must not show the other one. Fifteen peaks still have two
matching cuts; all are symmetry twins (losing either of two equivalent methyls), and the
validator lists them so a new compound with a genuine ambiguity gets looked at.

Three cases cannot be a clean cut, and say so rather than implying otherwise:

- **dehydration** ghosts the OH and adds *"the H comes off the carbon next door"*, because a
  skeletal drawing has no hydrogens to ghost
- **loss of HCl** ghosts the halogen, same caveat
- **loss of a single H** ghosts nothing and says *"nothing heavy left, so nothing is dashed"*

## Reading the plot

Every peak above the 5% line has **its mass printed directly above it**, the way real
instrument software does it — so a student never has to trace a stick down to the axis and
estimate whether it landed on 43 or 45. The axis carries minor ticks between labels and a
faint vertical gridline at each label as a second check.

Peaks the student is being asked about carry a **?** marker; their printed mass is drawn in
the darker ink. Once a marker is answered it shows the answer instead, and the mass stays
printed on the plot underneath. Where a peak is too tall for its marker to sit above it, the
marker moves to the side rather than covering the number.

## Where the spectra come from

**Every spectrum is generated, not scanned.** `src/js/compounds.js` holds a peak table per
compound — m/z, relative abundance, the ion, and the role it plays. Nothing is copied from
a spectral database, which matters for the same reason it does in the IR package: SDBS and
similar databases prohibit systematic redistribution, which a package handed out through an
LMS plainly is.

Three things are **added** at draw time rather than typed into the bank:

- **Isotope peaks.** M+1 from the carbon count (1.1% per carbon) and M+2 from any chlorine
  (32%) or bromine (97%), computed from the molecular formula. They cannot be entered wrong,
  and the M+1 height really does count the carbons.
- **¹³C satellites** on every substantial fragment — the same effect one level down.
- **Noise** — a seeded scatter of sticks at 0.4–3%, fresh on every draw.

Abundances wobble a few percent from draw to draw, so a student cannot memorise a picture.
**Peak positions never move**: unlike an IR band, 43 is 43.

Relative intensities are rounded and idealised. Peak *identities* and base peaks are the
real ones — but if you want a compound's numbers to match a particular reference more
closely, they are one edit away in `compounds.js` and `ANSWER_KEY.md` regenerates from them.

### The arithmetic is machine-checked

A mass spectrum is arithmetic, so the arithmetic can be verified. `tools/validate.js`
parses every molecular formula and every ion formula and checks that

```
ion formula + neutral lost = molecular formula
```

with no negative atom counts anywhere. A mistyped m/z cannot survive that check, and the
build fails rather than shipping a spectrum that does not add up. The validator shares its
formula parser with the renderer, so the numbers students see are checked by the same code
that draws them.

---

## Isotope patterns

The M+2 peak is a drop target for the halogen compounds, because reading it *is* the
lesson:

- **chlorine** — M+2 about a third the height of M⁺ (³⁵Cl : ³⁷Cl is 3:1)
- **bromine** — M+2 about equal to M⁺ (⁷⁹Br : ⁸¹Br is 1:1)

An M+2 only becomes a drop target when it clears the 5% reading threshold. Marking a peak
that the same plot captions *"below this line — don't read it"* would contradict the rule
the whole activity teaches, and where M⁺ is faint the M+2 is fainter still. 1-chlorobutane
is the case in this bank: its M⁺ is about 12%, so its M+2 lands near 4% — drawn honestly,
but never asked about. `tools/validate.js` warns which halides this affects.

M+1 is never a drop target — it would be a tedious click — but it is drawn on every
compound with a visible molecular ion, and clicking it teaches the carbon count.

In the **What each labelled peak actually is** panel, an isotope peak is drawn as the
*whole molecule* with the heavy atom picked out in colour, captioned "the same molecule,
with ³⁷Cl in place of ³⁵Cl". Nothing broke and nothing left — which is the thing students
most often get wrong about M+2, so the picture says it directly rather than showing a
fragment that does not exist.

The **nitrogen rule** is taught through the amines: 1-propanamine's molecular ion at 59 and
diethylamine's at 73 are both odd, and the feedback says why.

---

## When there is no molecular ion

*tert*-Butanol and isooctane produce **essentially no molecular ion** — they fall apart the
instant they ionise, because the cation on offer is so stable. You cannot subtract from a
peak that is not there, so those compounds are tagged out of Level 1 entirely; the validator
enforces it, refusing a `loss` tag on any compound whose molecular ion is under 5%.

They appear at Levels 2 and 3 instead, where the missing M⁺ becomes evidence in its own
right: *no molecular ion means a very stable cation forms immediately — think tertiary.*

1-butanol, 2-butanol and MTBE sit in between: their molecular ions are real but around 1%,
drawn and clickable but too faint to measure a loss from. `ANSWER_KEY.md` distinguishes the
two cases explicitly.

---

## The McLafferty decision

This package does not teach the McLafferty rearrangement. That constrains the bank, because
**deleting a real peak would be a lie** — a student who later looks up the reference spectrum
would find a peak that this activity pretended was not there.

So the bank works two ways:

- Compounds whose base peak *is* a McLafferty product are simply excluded. That rules out
  butanal and longer aldehydes, most carboxylic acids (butanoic acid's base peak is the
  McLafferty at m/z 60), 2-hexanone, and the larger esters.
- Compounds with a **minor** McLafferty peak keep it. 2-pentanone (m/z 58) and butylbenzene
  (m/z 92) are both in the bank, both with a clean non-McLafferty base peak, and both draw
  the rearrangement peak honestly. Clicking it says: *"it comes from a rearrangement rather
  than a simple cleavage — the molecule folds over and passes a hydrogen across before it
  breaks. That is not part of this unit, so leave it alone for now."*

`tools/validate.js` refuses to let a peak marked `mcl` carry an ion id or become a drop
target, so a McLafferty peak can never be scored by accident.

---

## The compound bank

30 compounds across six themes. The draw is **balanced by theme, not purely random**: every
level takes one compound per theme before filling the remaining places freely, so a run
always contains an alcohol, a carbonyl, an arene, a branched chain, a heteroatom compound
and a halide.

**No compound is ever drawn twice in the same run.** The used-list is kept for the whole
sitting rather than per pool, so a student meets eighteen different spectra across the
three levels. (It was once kept per pool, which let a compound tagged for two levels turn
up in both — that is fixed, and `tools/validate.js` now fails the build if any theme
guarantee could only be met by repeating a compound.)

| Theme | Compounds | Teaches |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **alcohol** | 1-butanol, 2-butanol, *tert*-butanol, 2-methyl-2-butanol, cyclohexanol, 1-phenylethanol | α-cleavage at 1°/2°/3°, and −18 |
| **carbonyl** | acetone, 2-butanone, 3-pentanone, 2-pentanone, acetophenone, benzaldehyde, methyl acetate | the fragment that keeps the C=O — m/z 43, 57, 105 |
| **arene** | toluene, ethyl-, propyl-, isopropyl- and butylbenzene | m/z 91, and breaking next to a ring |
| **branch** | hexane, 2-methylbutane, 2,2-dimethylbutane, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane | the tertiary carbocation at 57 |
| **hetero** | 1-propanamine, diethylamine, diethyl ether, MTBE | α-cleavage at N and at ether O |
| **halide** | 1-bromopropane, 1-chlorobutane, chlorobenzene, bromobenzene | M/M+2 isotope patterns |

Level 3 guarantees neither a halide nor an arene. A C–X bond simply breaks, with no second
route to weigh it against; and every alkylbenzene except cumene gives m/z 91 with nothing
competing, so there is nothing to predict. Cumene can still be drawn into one of Level 3's
free slots — it just is not *forced*, which would mean repeating it whenever Levels 1–2 had
already taken it. The validator checks theme coverage per level accordingly.

### The sets worth pointing at in class

- **1-butanol / 2-butanol / *tert*-butanol / diethyl ether** — four C₄H₁₀O isomers, all
  M = 74, base peaks **31 / 45 / 59 / 59**. Primary, secondary and tertiary α-cleavage in
  one family.
- **propylbenzene / cumene / acetophenone** — all M = 120, base peaks **91 / 105 / 105**.
  A −29 against a −15, and at 105 a ring-plus-methyl fragment against a ring-plus-C=O one.
- **hexane / 2,2-dimethylbutane** — both C₆H₁₄, M = 86, base **43 vs 57**. One has a visible
  molecular ion and a smooth run of clusters; the other has essentially no M⁺ and one
  dominant peak. That contrast *is* the evidence for a branch point.
- **2-methyl-2-butanol** — one compound showing −15, −18 and −29 at once, where losing the
  larger radical (ethyl, giving m/z 59) beats losing the smaller one (methyl, giving m/z 73).
  Comparing those two peaks is the whole stability lesson in a single spectrum.

### Decoys have to be decidable

A student decides the identify question from the peaks they just labelled, so those peaks
are the only fair evidence. Two compounds with an identical scored-peak set are never
offered against each other — **acetophenone and cumene** both put peaks at 77, 105 and 120,
and nothing this activity asks about separates them. `tools/validate.js` prints these
clusters and `ANSWER_KEY.md` lists them.

Decoys are otherwise ranked to prefer compounds sharing the answer's peaks, its theme, its
molecular weight, and above all its molecular formula — so 1-butanol comes up against
2-butanol, separated by m/z 31 against 45, which is exactly the primary/secondary
distinction being taught. The ranking carries a small random term, so the same compound does
not always draw the same pair.

### Distractor tiles

Distractors are drawn from the four losses the unit is built around — −15, −18, −29, −43 —
before anything else, because those are the ones a student should be checking for every
single time. Level 1 offers two distractors, Level 2 three.

### A halide always faces a halide

An M+2 doublet is visible from across the room. If the answer were the only halogen
compound on offer, the question would answer itself with no chemistry at all — so when the
answer contains Cl or Br, **at least one rival must too**, preferring the *same* halogen.
Chlorobenzene comes up against bromobenzene and 1-chlorobutane: identical structures but
for the halogen, so the student has to read the 3:1 against the 1:1 *and* check the
molecular mass. Bromobenzene is in the bank for exactly this reason.

---

## Grading

**Completion only.** The SCO writes `cmi.core.lesson_status = "completed"` once a student
finishes all three levels and writes no numeric score, so the Schoology column reads
complete / incomplete rather than a percent.

Students still see their own first-try accuracy on the level-complete and finish screens —
it just isn't reported.

To report a percent instead, set `cmi.core.score.raw` alongside the status in
`markComplete()` in `src/js/scorm.js` and add an `<adlcp:masteryscore>` to
`src/imsmanifest.xml`.

Progress is saved to `cmi.suspend_data` when the activity opens and after every answer, so
a student who closes the window mid-activity resumes where they left off. It also mirrors to
`localStorage`, which is what makes resume work outside an LMS.

The save carries a schema version (`SCHEMA` in `src/js/game.js`). **Bump it whenever you
change the level list, the draw or the vocabulary** — a save written by an older build is
then discarded rather than resumed. Without that, a student carries a stale lineup of
spectra forward and never sees your edits.

---

## Building and uploading

```bash
./build.sh                     # → dist/ms-reading-fragments-v1.zip
./build.sh ms-unit9-practice   # → dist/ms-unit9-practice.zip
```

`imsmanifest.xml` has to sit at the root of the zip, which is why `build.sh` zips from
inside `src/` rather than from the project root. Zipping the `src` folder itself produces a
package Schoology rejects.

To upload:

1. In your Schoology course, **Add Materials → Add File/Link/External Tool → Add File** and
   upload `dist/ms-reading-fragments-v1.zip`, or use **Add Materials → Package** if your
   install shows it.
2. Schoology detects the SCORM manifest and creates a SCORM item.
3. Open the item's settings and enable the gradebook column if you want completion tracked.
4. Open it once as a student (Preview as Student) to confirm the badge in the top right
   reads **Connected to the LMS**.

If that badge reads **Standalone — no LMS detected** inside Schoology, the SCO could not
find the SCORM API. That is almost always a nesting problem, not a code problem.

### Testing without an LMS

Open `src/index.html` directly in a browser. The activity runs identically; the badge reads
*Standalone* and nothing is reported.

### Putting one named spectrum on the board

```
src/index.html?compound=butanone&level=1
```

`compound` is any `id` from `ANSWER_KEY.md`; `level` is 1, 2 or 3. If the compound is not
tagged for the level you asked for, it falls back to one it is tagged for. A pinned spectrum
never writes to saved progress, so demoing in class will not disturb a student's resume
state.

---

## Editing the content

Everything a teacher would want to change lives in two files.

**`src/js/compounds.js`** — the bank. To add a compound, copy an existing entry:

```js
{
  id: 'propiophenone', name: 'Propiophenone', formula: 'C₉H₁₀O', f: 'C9H10O',
  cls: 'Aryl ketone', theme: 'carbonyl', tags: ['loss', 'predict'],
  structure: { pts: [...], bonds: [...], labels: {...} },
  peaks: [
    { mz: 134, ab: 25, role: 'mplus' },
    { mz: 105, ab: 100, ion: 'phco', role: 'key',
      why: 'α-cleavage drops the ethyl and leaves a benzoyl cation …' },
    { mz: 77,  ab: 50, ion: 'ph', role: 'key', why: '…' },
    { mz: 51,  ab: 20, ion: 'c4h3', role: 'cluster' }
  ]
}
```

- `f` is the parseable formula, checked against the displayed one.
- `role` is `mplus`, `key` (scored), `cluster` (above the line, not diagnostic), `minor`
  (below the line), or `mcl` (a McLafferty peak, never scored).
- `tags` are `'loss'` (Levels 1 and 2 — needs a molecular ion above 5%) and `'predict'`
  (Level 3 — needs two or more competing losses).
- `why` is required on every `key` peak — it is the stability argument, and Level 3 reads it.
- `note` optionally overrides the generated explanation for a non-scored peak, for cases
  where the stock wording would mislead.
- `isotopeTarget: true` makes the M+2 peak a drop target. Use it for halides.

**`src/js/fragments.js`** — the vocabulary: the `LOSSES` table, the `IONS` table, and the
`hint` strings shown as feedback. That is where to put the wording you use in class.

After any edit:

```bash
node tools/validate.js              # arithmetic, ambiguity and level-eligibility checks
node tools/answer-key.js > ANSWER_KEY.md
./build.sh
```

`tools/validate.js` is worth running every time. It refuses a bank where:

- a fragment does not balance against the molecular formula, or an ion is listed at the
  wrong m/z;
- two peaks share an m/z, or two scored peaks would answer to the same tile at either level;
- a compound has no base peak, or more than one;
- a scored peak has no `why`, so Level 3 could not use it;
- a compound is tagged `loss` but its molecular ion is under 5%, or tagged `predict` with
  fewer than two competing cleavages;
- the `loss` pool holds fewer than the twelve compounds Levels 1 and 2 draw between them,
  or a theme inside it has only one member, since both levels would then draw it;
- a McLafferty peak carries an ion id;
- a level's pool is missing one of the themes that level draws.

It also warns about scored peaks below the reading threshold, and about ions no compound
uses — those still teach in the reference table and still make fair distractors, but it is
worth knowing which are carrying their weight.

`scorm.js` is shared with the IR package — the code is identical, only the header comment
differs. A SCORM zip has to be self-contained, so it is duplicated rather than linked; if
you fix a bug in one, fix it in both:

`structures.js` **started** as the IR package's renderer and has since grown one thing that
package does not need: `opts.keeps`, the list of vertices a fragment holds on to, plus
`opts.charge` for the **+**. Everything else is the same. The additions are inert when the
options are absent, so the file could be copied back to the IR package unchanged if that
ever became useful.

No CDN, no web fonts, no network calls of any kind. A 40 KB zip that works offline inside a
locked-down LMS iframe.

A built `dist/ms-reading-fragments-v1.zip` is committed, so you can download and upload it
without running the build.

## Accessibility

Every drop works three ways, so it does not assume a mouse: pointer drag, click-the-label
then click-the-peak, and keyboard (tab to a label, Enter, tab to a peak, Enter). Peaks and
labels carry text alternatives naming their m/z and relative abundance, feedback is
announced through an ARIA live region, and `prefers-reduced-motion` disables the shake
animation. Colour is never the only signal — correct placements change border style and show
the label text, and the reading threshold is a drawn, captioned line rather than a shade of
ink.
